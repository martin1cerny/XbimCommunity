# XbimCommunity

This is a temporal repository where I try to get in touch with people who have touched any of [xbim Toolkit repositories](https://github.com/xBimTeam) in past by
 - raising an issue
 - commenting on the issue
 - forking the project
 - referencing one of our NuGet packages in their GitHub project(s)
 - following the project

I don't intend to spam anybody and appreciate you may not be interested anymore. If this is your case, [get in touch with me please](mailto:martin.cerny@xbim.net).
